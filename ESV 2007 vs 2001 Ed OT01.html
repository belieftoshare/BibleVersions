<div class="blog-entry-body">A mild revision of the English
Standard Version has been released this year, and this new series
which I will roll out over the next few days will attempt to
provide an exhaustive list of changes between the 2001 and 2007
editions of the ESV. The first glimpse of these changes was seen
last year when the ESV Reverse Interlinear became the first
publication to contain the revised New Testament. At that time, I
offered a <a href="../files/20061113_truth_unchanged_not_changed_that_much.html" rel="self" title="Blog/Home:Truth Unchanged Not Changed That Much: A Preliminary Survey of Updates to the ESV New Testament">
preliminary survey of changes</a> between the two editions simply
based on my search for differences in the text.<br>
<br>

Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.accordancebible.com" rel="self">OakTree Software</a> released the updated edition of the ESV
as a separate module from the original one. The changes between the
editions are relatively minor, but I had petitioned OakTree earlier
this year to keep the modules separate for sake of comparison. For
whatever reason, Crossway and the Standard Bible Society opted not
to release a list of the changes in spite of the fact that there
was earlier indication that they would. Evidently, the changes were
such a tightly kept secret that they wouldn't even give a list of
changes to OakTree, but rather gave them a brand new etext that had
to be prepped along with footnotes and cross-references.
Undoubtedly, a simple list of corrections would have made the
update a much easier task, but as Helen Brown <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21821574&amp;postID=1360750606334971235" rel="self">noted in the comments</a> over at the Accordance
Blog:<br>
<blockquote>
<p>If Crossway had supplied a list of corrections, our work would
have been trivial, but we had to start over with a new etext and
redo all three modules. In order to stay in business we do have to
try to cover our costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
Her last statement is in reference to the $10 upgrade fee (very
reasonable in my opinion) charged to those who had the original ESV
text in Accordance.<br>
<br>
Now that I have both the 2001 and 2007 ESV editions available as
separate modules in Accordance, I can use the comparison tool to
find what should be an exhaustive list of changes between the
editions. As I've already said, the changes are fairly minor in the
big scheme of things. Unlike the significant change in the 1996 and
2004 editions of the NLT, the ESV update is really more of the
standard "second run" with a few minor fixes that most translations
experience (consider the 1978 and 1984 editions of the NIV, but
compare John 1:18 in both).<br>

<br>
Some of the changes are related to spelling or grammar, and a few
reflect mild theological change (see Num 21:3 for instance). I am
going to list the changes without commentary (other than to say Gen
30:35 is quite the chuckler), but I encourage discussion of the
significance of any of these changes in the comments for this post.
Over the next few days, I will display changes throughout the
entire Bible between the two editions of the ESV.<br>
<br>
For now, here is the Pentateuch:<br>
