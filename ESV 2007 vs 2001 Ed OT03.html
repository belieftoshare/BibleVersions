<h1 class="blog-entry-title">2007 ESV Changes: Job - Song of
Solomon</h1>

<div class="blog-entry-body">Below is the third set of changes
between the ESV 2001 and 2007 editions. This post focuses on Wisdom
Literature or Job through Song of Solomon.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://voiceofiyov.blogspot.com/" rel="external">Iyov</a>
has been diligent to check my references and most of the errors in
previous posts have come from hyphenated words. In performing a bit
of translational textual criticism, my hunch is that the original
ESV 2001 modules for both Accordance and Logos both came from scans
of the ESV Classic Reference Bible because most of the mistakes
found in the etexts have been at hyphenated breaks that occur in
this specific edition. The Logos module of the 2001 edition is
slightly more up to date than the Accordance module, but this isn't
too surprising since Logos and Crossway seems to have a fairly
close business relationship as evidenced in the ESV Reverse
Interlinear NT. This makes it even more interesting that OakTree
would release the 2007 update before Logos.<br>

<br>
We've also discovered that evidently Crossway has made some of
these changes along the way before the 2007 release, such as
changing <em>upwards</em> to <em>upward</em> in 2 Chron 31:17 as
demonstrated in the <a href="../files/20070621_2007_esv_joshua_esther.html" rel="self" title="Blog/Home:2007 ESV Changes: Joshua - Esther">last post</a> (see
also the discussion in the comments). Early releases contained the
words <em>upwards</em>, but there have been editions of the ESV
before the 2007 edition that also contained the changed word,
<em>upward</em>. I'm not certain how many other changes were also
added between the editions. Nevertheless, I'm posting here any
alteration from the 2001 edition that I find.<br>
<br>

The changes made in the Wisdom Literature below are fewer than the
number in the previous post of the <a href="../files/20070621_2007_esv_joshua_esther.html" rel="self" title="Blog/Home:2007 ESV Changes: Joshua - Esther">Historical Books</a>.
Nevertheless, some of these are more interesting. Again, comments
and discussion are welcome and encouraged.<br>
