<div class="blog-entry-body">This post is my second in an attempt
to create an exhaustive list of the changes made between the 2001
and 2007 editions of the English Standard Version. Again, I am
posting them without comments of my own, but encourage discussion
in the comments of this post.<br>
<br>
Below is the list of changes beginning in Joshua and going through
Esther (although no changes actually occur in the latter
book):<br>
